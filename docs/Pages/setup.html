    <h1>Cloning & Setting up this Repository</h1>
    <h2>Cloning in VS 2022</h2>
    <p>If you would like to test out all the commands & features that are shown in the tutorials, you can clone <br /> this
       repository in your preferred IDE and run the Bot on your own system. <br /> <br /> </p>

    <h2>Setting up the config.json file</h2>
    <p>Next, we need to import the NuGet Packages (DSharpPlus) in this solution & we also need to input in our Token and Prefix into the "config.json" file</p>
    
    <h3>2.  Build the Solution to import the NuGet Packages</h3>

    <p>You should get <b>1 Succeeded</b> in the output, and if you check your solution in the file explorer, you should have a <b>"../bin/Debug"</b> Folder <br />
       which is actually the folder that contains your application when you click <b>Start</b>. There should also be dll files which should be the DSharpPlus packages that were imported</p>

    <h3>3.  Setup the config.json file with a Token & Prefix for your Bot</h3>
    <p>Once you have imported the packages, the next step is to open the <b>config.json</b> file to add in your Token & Prefix <br />
       You can get a token by going into the <b>Discord Developer Portal</b>. <br /> <br />
       <b>PLEASE READ:</b> You must take this config.json file and COPY it over to the <b>/bin/Debug</b> folder as shown in the photo above</p>

    <h3>4.  Start up the Bot</h3>
    <p>Once you have imported the NuGet packages and setup the Token/Prefix of the Bot, it is now ready to start. Click start at the top to begin execution of the Bot <br />
       You should get a message with the version of DSharpPlus you are running and your Bot should come online</p>
