## About

This is a C# Discord Bot coded through a series of tutorial videos. The whole point of this tutorial is to teach people how to make a Discord Bot and have fun using it in their own servers and maybe even on public servers.

## Follow the YouTube Tutorial

This Bot is being coded in a YouTube tutorial series by SamJesus8. He will teach you every single step needed to make this a good, clean & functioning Discord Bot. Everything from Bot Setup, Commands, Games and many many different functions will be covered here in this tutorial.

This is a good insight for people wanting to code a Discord Bot, or learners who are learning C# and want to take on more complex projects. This tutorial alone will also cover a lot of C# coding tips & tricks as well as some fundamentals to coding in C# such as the use of Classes, StreamReaders, Asynchronous Logic and a lot more key components in the coding language.

There is a lot of interchange between coding in C# and learning to make a Discord Bot so be sure to give it your all when coding your own
